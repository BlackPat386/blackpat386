<p> Hello class my name Patrick Smith and this is my fourth-semester attending CCSF. I'm originally from Daytona Beach, Florida and have been residing in California for a little past two years. Previously before relocating to NorCal i was stationed in San Diego for five years when i was enlisted in the military. While i'm currently finishing up requisites for my AS in Cisco networking i've always had a passion for learning additional facets of IT/CS such as coding.</p>
<p>Since a young age i have always been interested in specifically on the hardware side for example such as routers, PC's and cables. As i've started to become more knowledgable of the IT industry,coding and sofware development became more interesting. In 2021 i enrolled into CCSF to pursue a degree in computer networking and found it the perfect opportunity to enroll in a couple coding classes to become more familiar with software development. While i won't say that coding is my "forte",it is beneficial today to be familiar with the basics of HTML/CSS to have a competitive edge in today's tech market </p>
